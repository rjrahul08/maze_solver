Maze Solver:
- Worked on making a maze solver GUI where user can input a maze and specify the target point user wants to find path by a single mouse click. 
- Implemented DFS algorithm to find the path from starting to ending point in maze.
- Made the application using java swing and awt.

Features:-
1. Allow user to change the start point.
2. Implement other graph algorithms.
3. Allow user to change input matrix.
4. Display the shortest distance or the distance algorithm traversed to reach target point.
